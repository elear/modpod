# MODeration PrOceDures (MODPOD)

## Background

The IETF has a number of processes to address moderation of participants in non-face-to-face venues (e.g., RFC3934, RFC9245, BCP83, and “IESG Statement of Disruptive Posting”) in response to behavior which violates the IETF guidelines for conduct (RFC7154).  Experience implementing moderation in the IETF has found:

- Inconsistency between working group and plenary lists policies;
- A lack of defined policies for forums beyond email (e.g., chat, wikis);
- Inconsistent application of existing policies due to community disagreement on the thresholds for reacting to disruptive behavior
- Application of RFC3934 or posting-rights action (BCP83) to be perceived as cumbersome, slow, making it ill-suited to situations that escalate quickly;
- BCP83 is the only remedy for disruptive behavior spanning multiple mailing lists; and substantial strife in the community when BCP83 is used.

## Scope of Work

The MODPOD work group will revise existing and define a new moderation authority suitable for all IETF communication channels.  The approaches the WG defines will:

- Ensure that consistent moderation authorities exist for all channels/forums in the IETF
- Clarify who can take moderation actions on a per channel/forum basis, how they are selected and the terms of their service, and the authority afforded to them
- Clarify who can initiate or propose a moderation action
- Balance the need between privacy and dignity of individuals involved with the need for transparency.
- Be flexible to varying circumstances, allowing for timely, appropriate responses in each situation.
- Be capable of responding to patterns of behavior across channels/forums and moderating them collectively
- Enable the use of more consistent moderation actions across channels/forums
- Have a clear, consistent, and efficient path for appeal

The WG  will clarify how the moderation role and associated authority interact or overlap with other roles such as working group chairs and the IETF Ombudsteam.

As a starting point, the working group will consider draft-ecahc-moderation and draft-lear-bcp38-replacement and associated discussions.  An eventual proposal for the working group can be based on adopting aspects from these inputs or from a new approach.

The revising or redefining of related Ombudsteam policies or practices (e.g., RFC7776) or the IETF Guidelines for Conduct (RFC7154) is out of scope.

## Deliverables

At a minimum, the working group will update or obsolete BCP83, and may update or obsolete other related RFCs such as BCP45.  The group is expected to use as many modes of communication as well as interim meetings to bring this work to conclusion with alacrity, if at all possible.

## Milestones

- October 2024	WG adoption of one or more drafts
- March 2025 WGLC
